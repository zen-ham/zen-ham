## A bit about me

I'm a developer. I know Java, JS, HTML and C++ but I use Python daily, and have many years experience with it.

## My projects
My buisness is [Zelesis AI](https://zelesis.com/), check it out.

I've been actively developing my [zhmiscellany python package](https://github.com/zen-ham/zhmiscellany) for over a year. The main goal of this package is to keep as much helpful functionality in one place as possible, a python toolbox filled with utilities that can take a 300 line script to 30.

Me and a friend Apollo have been doing our own version of Deepseek's "Open Source Week", each releasing one repo we've made every day for a week.

### Day 1 Projects:

To start things off for day 1 I chose to bring the documentation for my python package full up to date, and behind the scenes upgrade my workflow to keep it that way.

I liked Apollo's Tales of Zenmania game so much that I decided to create and release my own version, introducing many new game mechanics and with a vastly more expansive story.
